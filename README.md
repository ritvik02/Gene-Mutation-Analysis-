# Gene-Mutation-Analysis

Got extremely large amounts of data from here (https://www.invitae.com/en/sponsored-testing/behind-the-seizure) for the years 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023  

- Cleaned the very complex large data thorougly to perform analysis 
- Developed top notch interactive visualizations comprising of time series, geospatial, etc to understand the distribution of genes across United States, Patient trends over the years and Institutions & clinician trends over the years to name a few

I have uploaded the HTML file which gives an idea of the visualizations. But for the visualizations to be rendered completely it is essential to run the jupyter notebook for which you would need the daatset. Please contact me at rk3213@columbia.edu and I will be happy to show you a demonstration.
